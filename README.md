# 🚗 4-Wheel Robot Simulation – SLAM & Navigation

This project demonstrates a 4-wheel robot performing **SLAM (mapping)** and **Autonomous Navigation** in a simulated environment using ROS 2, Gazebo, and Nav2.

## 🗺️ SLAM Mapping Demo
This video shows the robot performing **real-time mapping** of the environment using **SLAM Toolbox**.  
The robot is manually teleoperated while SLAM builds an occupancy grid map.
