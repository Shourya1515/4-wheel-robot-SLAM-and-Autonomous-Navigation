# 🚗 4-Wheel Robot Simulation – SLAM & Navigation

This repository contains a simulated 4-wheel robot built in ROS 2, capable of:

- 🗺️ **Mapping using SLAM Toolbox**
- 📍 **Localization using the generated map**
- 🧭 **Autonomous Navigation using Nav2**
- 🏠 **Simulation inside Gazebo Harmonic**

Below are two demonstration videos showing the robot performing SLAM and Navigation inside the simulated world.

## 🗺️ SLAM Mapping Demo

This video shows the robot performing **real-time SLAM mapping** of the environment using **SLAM Toolbox**.  
The robot is manually teleoperated while SLAM builds the occupancy grid map.
